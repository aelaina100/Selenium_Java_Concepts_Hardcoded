- Use a valid real-time synchronization technique in each test case (Explicit wait) ALONG with naming conventions for
  Class, Method, & Variable.

- Using the correct synchronization techniques of explicit waits are crucial for" added_12.java class file.

- Use soft assertions for Added13_AssignmentTest.java  since its a flow testcase (is that right ?)

- After reviewing JAVA STREAMS, check back on: Added18_TC2_Interview_AddingItemsIntoCart_debugMode (and all methods in this .java class files), to
  ensure that all methods/testcases are optimized with Java streams.
  
  In Added20_Synchronization.java,  expand on how Thread.sleep() can only be used for certain captcha verifications.
  
  What is the most suitable explicit wait method for a field to enter a value in. ??
