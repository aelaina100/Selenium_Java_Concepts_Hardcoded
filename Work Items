- Use a valid real-time synchronization technique in each test case (Explicit wait) ALONG with naming conventions for
  Class, Method, & Variable.

- Using the correct synchronization techniques of explicit waits are crucial for" added_12.java class file.

- Use soft assertions for Added13_AssignmentTest.java  since its a flow testcase (is that right ?)

- After reviewing JAVA STREAMS, check back on: Added18_TC2_Interview_AddingItemsIntoCart_debugMode (and all methods in this .java class files), to
  ensure that all methods/testcases are optimized with Java streams.
  
  In Added20_Synchronization.java,  expand on how Thread.sleep() can only be used for certain captcha verifications.
  
  What is the most suitable explicit wait method for a field to enter a value in. ??
  
  How to determine: x offset & y offset (For example they're utilized in Action class methods. Specifically in 
 .moveToElement( WebElement target, int xOffset, int yOffset) and many more methods notnecessarily related to the Action class.

Study the 'Watch' and 'Add new expression" feature in Eclipse (Section 10: Techniques to automate Ajax calls,....Lecture 89: Live example on working
with child window)

Write a frame utility to know how many frames exist on a webpage and if there are frames inside the frames on the webpage.

Examine section AAA in:  Added20_synchronization.java  where methods of Explicit wait are pasted from cht gpt

Study/ improve (if possible) synchronization for printLinksCountTest() testcase/method in Added31_printLinksCount
