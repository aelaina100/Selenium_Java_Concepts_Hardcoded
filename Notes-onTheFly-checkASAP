Use a valid real-time synchronization technique in each test case (Explicit wait) ALONG with naming conventions for
Class, Method, & Variable.

Using the correct synchronization techniques of explicit waits are crucial for" added_12.java class file.

Use soft assertions for Added13_AssignmentTest.java  since its a flow testcase (is that right ?)
